# Codecademy - React Challenge

This is a solution to the Codecademy React Challenge Project. If you want to run it on your own computer rather than on the netlify website listed below, you must use `npm start` (for the development build) or `npm run build` (for the production build). You can also use yarn (`yarn start` and `yarn run build`) if you prefer. This project is made using the React Router 5.2 version, and will probably be updated in a later release.
